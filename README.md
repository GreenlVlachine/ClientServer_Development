# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing the CRUD module, I made sure the functions were broken down logically and had easily understandable naming schemes.  This was very important to me, as in one of the later modules the Notebook was trying to produce too much information and failing to launch the Dash application.  I was able to review my Python module and and noticed I had included a print line as part of my read function.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Working in the Notebook was a new experience for me, and it made setting up test cases for functionality very easy to implement. In past courses or assignments, I feel like there was a lot of tinkering around until the project finally ran, but debugging and testing functions was key in tackling the dashboard requirements.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

When I started classes, I assumed I was going to learn how to code. And while I have been learning just that, I've also been learning much more. Copmuter scientists don't just develop software; they study algorithms, databases, and more to solve problems as efficiently as possible. They have impact in a variety of industries, and could be a boon to many company's operations by providing data-driven insights.
